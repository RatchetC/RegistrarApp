# RegistrarApp

Welcome to the RegistrarApp repository. This app is going to be used to register members of the public to the event that the admin has created on the **[EventCreatorApp](https://github.com/RatchetC/MSF-Database-and-API/tree/master/code/production/EventCreatorApp)**. The app allows the user to register the members of the public to the event under nicknames. The user of the app also has the ability to change which event the members of the public are being registered to though this should ideally be done once per event by the admin of the group that is running the event.
