### Cordova

To install Cordova please ensure that you have installed NodeJS and that npm was installed along with it (it should be).

You can do this by running the `node -v` and the `npm -v` commands in either the Command Prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac/Linux).

Once you've confirmed that NodeJS and npm are installed on your machine, you can run the `npm install -g cordova` command to install Cordova onto your machine

The following snippet shows you exactly this.

```bash
$ node -v
v8.9.0
$ npm -v
v5.5.1
$ npm install -g cordova
```

### Ionic

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```
